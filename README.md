# C4GT-2023
Code for GovTech(C4GT) is an annual summer coding program that aims to cultivate a community capable of creating and contributing to global Digital Public Goods. To connect with the community, a detailed proposal was submitted. The desire to learn and improve oneself compelled me to contribute to this open-source project. 
The main objective of the project is to create an open-source project, that serves as a platform for widely accepted Health Claims data exchange specifications as a public good that can be accepted. It should be open to supporting technology and vendor neutrality, and adaptable to changes and innovations. 
Milestones :
Milestone 1: Create the overall system design for the SDK, taking scalability, interoperability, and security into account.
Milestone 2: Consider the relevant data pieces, entities, and relationships while creating the data model and schema for health claim exchange.
Milestone 3: Enable integration with already-existing healthcare systems, including payer systems, electronic medical record (EMR) systems, and government health information exchanges.
Milestone 4: To aid developers in understanding and utilizing the SDK, create extensive documentation, tutorials, and API reference guides.
Milestone 5: To obtain input and identify areas for improvement, do beta testing with a select group of users, healthcare providers, and payers.
Milestone 6: Release the SDK to the developer community and make it widely available for use.
Thanking Note :
Thank you so much to all of the mentors and the entire community for allowing me to work on such an interesting project. I will do all in my power to add value to this community. Thank you for listening to all of my concerns while developing this proposal, and thank you in advance for the mentorship and direction that all of you bring to help us grow and improve our talents. I'm looking forward to the exciting road ahead and am eager to learn new things.
